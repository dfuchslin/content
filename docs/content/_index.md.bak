Twenty-twenty has certainly been an interesting year. The year started out innocent enough, but when the full brunt of the virus arrived in Sweden this spring we were lucky enough to have jobs that easily allowed us to work from home.

David is still a consultant at Valtech Sweden (14 years now), the last two years at SAS Scandinavian Airlines, working on their website, app, APIs and improvement of deployments, automation, and security. Joachim is still at Collectum, Sweden's largest pension management company, improving performance and effectiveness of its customer service department, and leading its new RPA automation project.

After a long period of "should we or shouldn't we", we finally decided to cancel our planned trip in March to California mere days before all flights were cancelled and borders were closed. Instead of vacation, we opted for a staycation. We completed a house project we started last fall: our gravel garden. Last fall, we dug out 9 tonnes of weeds, dirst, rocks on the plateau in the back yard. We then filled it with a truck load of gravel, of course adding in pipes for automatic water and low-voltage electricity for the coming garden.

Summertime came and Mamma Nancy's planned visit was also cancelled. This gave us the opportunity for more staycation, this time repainting the house. With lots of help from Jocke's brother Daniel, neices Maya and Julia, and brother-in-law Alex, four weeks and twelve 10-liter buckets of expensive, thick paint later, we were done... with 75% of the house. We will save the remaining walls on the backside of the house for next summer, now that we have learned the tips and tricks of how to paint more efficiently.

As all airlines, SAS has had a very tough time during 2020. With layoffs of over 50% of its employees and consultants, David has been lucky to survive the cuts. So it was really nice that after summer David was able to go back to work in the office (with coworkers!) for two days a week. That came to an end of course later in the fall when the world's second corona waves started to swell and 100% work-from-home was the norm again. We reflected on the fact of how lucky we were to have moved from our 48m<sup>2</sup> apartment in the city a few years ago to a much bigger house in the 'burbs. We can work in separate rooms, have our Teams/Skype calls without disturbing each other! We treated ourselves recently to upgrading our home office with a nice, fully automatic Swiss coffee machine. One-touch flat white, yes please!

We have been lucky to have contact with Jocke's family, lots of outdoor social-distanced fikas, meals, meetups. And visits from Jocke's neices and nephews, with some sleepover Fortnite/game nights as well! Looking forward to many more of those!

This fall has pretty much been work-from-home, social distancing, everything remote, even David's yoga classes were held via Zoom (which worked surprisingly well). Now, December has come and almost gone; this year has flown by so quickly it's hard to believe the year has already passed! We are lucky to have our jobs, lucky to have our health, lucky to have family and friends nearby! We are looking forward to a new year and the possibility to travel again (though we probably will just have a staycation again anyway, with so much fun stuff to do on the house anyway!)

Merry Xmas, Happy Holidays, and a Happy 2021!

-- David & Joachim
