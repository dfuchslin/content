Hello! I'm a software developer in Stockholm, Sweden, working for an international consulting company. My blog is mostly guides and how-tos of little projects I've done here and there. I hope you can benefit from these posts, but mostly they are here to help remind me how I got from A to B six months later when I forget ;)

I've rid myself of my old Frankenbox home server and now have a great, energy-efficient QNAP NAS. I've come to realize its strengths and weaknesses and you will see some posts here reflecting the modifications I've made in order to get things to work exactly how I want them to work on my home network. I'm content with my QNAP mostly for its form factor, energy efficiency and performance; its software leaves a lot to be desired, hence these pages which document the modifications I've made to improve my experience.

Thanks for reading!
