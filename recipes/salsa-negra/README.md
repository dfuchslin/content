# Salsa negra

Here's a recipe for my interpretation of a salsa first introduced to me by the 1990's California tex-mex restaurant chain Baja Fresh. As time marches relentless on, so fade the crisp details in memory, and the recipe has gone through various iterations. This is how I currently make the salsa, more or less. Mine probably tastes nothing like the original!

The basic principle of salsa negra as I make it (_negra_ means black) is blackened tomatoes and jalapeños mixed in with fresh tomatoes, onion, garlic, lime, and cilantro (coriander leaves). So we just need to blacken the tomatoes and jalapeños, then the rest is a quick blitz in a blender. Blackening the tomatoes takes a while (30min-ish), but the rest is only a couple minutes of prep. And a few hours chilling in the fridge.

|------:|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ~800g | Romantica/cherry tomatoes (sweet, small)                                |
| 2     | Jalapeño peppers                                                        |
| 1     | Yellow (or white/silver) onion, quartered                               |
| ~1-2  | Garlic cloves, hacked (can use pre-hacked, frozen Picard)               |
| 1     | Lime, juiced                                                            |
| ~25ml | Cilantro (coriander leaves), hacked (can use pre-hacked, frozen Picard) |


## Preparation

Preheat the oven to the hottest temperature, broiler setting. You can also use a bbq grill if you wish. One downside with using a bbq grill is that the juices leak down onto the flames; in the oven the tomatoes retain more of their juice and you can keep some of the tomato juice in the pan, scraped into the blender.

Slice the jalapeños lengthwise, remove the stems, scrape out the seeds (or leave them in if you want a spicier salsa). Place about 2/3 of the tomatoes and jalapeños (green side up) in an oven pan. Slide the pan in the oven, at the topmost position closest to the broiler coils. Let the tomatoes and jalapeños get _really_ black. Keep an eye on them, roll the tomatoes around to get a lot of black. The jalapeños will blacken quicker, remove them when they are totally black with some flesh left underneath. But the tomatoes will take longer. I think the last time I made the salsa it took around 30-45 minutes to get them nice and blackened. You can see in this picture that the jalapeños are done, but I put the tomatoes back in the oven to get them much more blackened!

While the tomatoes are blackening, get your blender ready. In the blender, put the remaining ~1/3 tomatoes, quartered onion, hacked garlic, lime juice, and cilantro. When the tomatoes and jalapeños are nice and blackened,  scrape them into the blender. Scrape any of the residual (if any) tomato juices from the oven pan into the blender as well.

Now just blitz and pulse the mixture for 30 seconds or longer in the blender until it looks about right. It should have a nice consistency, not too chunky. Think about how you want to dip your chips in the salsa: does it look right?

Pour the salsa into a container and put it in the fridge. Let it cool for a few hours. Then enjoy! Make sure to use really good corn tortilla chips! (obs! the chips in this picture were _not_ good)
